# Backend Integration Analysis & Implementation Plan

## Current Status Analysis

### 1. Backend Integration - Many features need API endpoints

**✅ WORKING APIs:**
- Leave Management: `/api/leave/*` (requests, balances, calendar, analytics)
- Performance Management: `/api/performance/*` (reviews, goals, analytics)
- Compliance Management: `/api/compliance/*` (alerts, dashboard, trainings)
- Payroll System: `/api/payroll/*` (periods, calculations, structures)
- Employee Management: `/api/employees/*` (employees, departments)
- Health Check: `/api/health/*`

**❌ MISSING/INCOMPLETE APIs:**
- Recruiting: `/api/recruiting/*` (job-postings, candidates, interviews) - 500 errors
- Benefits: `/api/benefits/*` (plans, enrollments) - 500 errors
- Bonuses & Commissions: `/api/bonuses/*`, `/api/commissions/*` - Not implemented
- Analytics: `/api/analytics/*` - Missing dashboard endpoint
- Time Tracking: `/api/time-entries/*` - Not implemented
- Employee Profile: `/api/employees/{id}/*` - Missing detailed endpoints

### 2. Data Persistence - Forms don't save to database

**✅ WORKING FORMS:**
- Leave Management: Creates real leave requests
- Performance Management: Creates real goals and reviews
- Compliance Management: Generates and resolves alerts

**❌ BROKEN FORMS:**
- Recruiting: Job posting, candidate, and interview forms use mock data
- Benefits: Enrollment and plan management forms use mock data
- Bonuses & Commissions: All forms use mock data
- Employee Profile: Edit forms don't persist changes
- Settings: Some forms don't save to database

### 3. Real-time Updates - No live data synchronization

**❌ MISSING FEATURES:**
- No WebSocket implementation
- No real-time notifications
- No live data updates
- No automatic refresh mechanisms
- No push notifications

### 4. Authentication Scope - Some features bypass auth checks

**❌ SECURITY ISSUES:**
- Most API routes don't use `requireAuth` middleware
- Only settings routes have proper auth protection
- All other routes are publicly accessible
- No role-based access control
- No API rate limiting per user

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Missing API Endpoints

1. **Fix Recruiting API (500 errors)**
   - Debug database connection issues
   - Ensure recruiting tables exist
   - Test all recruiting endpoints

2. **Fix Benefits API (500 errors)**
   - Debug database connection issues
   - Ensure benefits tables exist
   - Test all benefits endpoints

3. **Implement Bonuses & Commissions API**
   - Create bonus and commission routes
   - Add database operations
   - Test CRUD operations

4. **Implement Missing Employee Profile APIs**
   - Add detailed employee endpoints
   - Add time entries, documents, training records
   - Add payroll history endpoints

### Phase 2: Fix Data Persistence

1. **Update Recruiting Forms**
   - Connect job posting forms to real API
   - Connect candidate forms to real API
   - Connect interview scheduling to real API

2. **Update Benefits Forms**
   - Connect enrollment forms to real API
   - Connect plan management to real API
   - Add real data persistence

3. **Update Bonuses & Commissions Forms**
   - Connect all forms to real APIs
   - Remove mock data usage
   - Add real data persistence

4. **Update Employee Profile Forms**
   - Connect edit forms to real APIs
   - Add data validation
   - Add error handling

### Phase 3: Implement Real-time Updates

1. **Add WebSocket Support**
   - Install Socket.io
   - Create WebSocket server
   - Add real-time event handling

2. **Add Live Data Updates**
   - Auto-refresh data on changes
   - Real-time notifications
   - Live dashboard updates

3. **Add Push Notifications**
   - Browser notification API
   - Real-time alerts
   - Status updates

### Phase 4: Fix Authentication Scope

1. **Add Authentication Middleware**
   - Add `requireAuth` to all protected routes
   - Add role-based access control
   - Add API rate limiting per user

2. **Implement Authorization**
   - Add user roles and permissions
   - Add resource-based access control
   - Add audit logging

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Add input validation
   - Add SQL injection prevention

## Priority Order

1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Fix Recruiting and Benefits APIs (500 errors)
2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Add authentication to all API routes
3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Fix data persistence for all forms
4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Implement missing API endpoints
5. **LOW PRIORITY**: Add real-time updates and notifications

## Success Metrics

- All API endpoints return 200 status codes
- All forms save data to database
- All API routes require authentication
- Real-time updates work for critical features
- No mock data in production
- 100% API test coverage
