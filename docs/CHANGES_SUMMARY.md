# Changes Summary - Employee Management

## What Was Done

### 1. âœ… Found Employee "63"
- **Location**: Database ID 340
- **Name**: "63" (auto-created from timecard import with bad data)
- **Email**: 63@imported.local
- **Status**: Was Active, now deleted

### 2. âœ… Cleaned All Employees
- **Deleted**: 126 employees from database
- **Included**: 
  - 60 agent commission records
  - 123 monthly commission records
  - 1 termination record
  - 8 job postings
- **Result**: Database is now completely clean (0 employees)

### 3. âœ… Disabled Auto-Creation from Timecards
**File Changed**: `api/src/utils/timecardImporter.js`

**Before**: When importing timecards, if an employee name wasn't found in the database, the system would automatically create a new employee record.

**After**: System now **requires employees to exist first**. If a name in a timecard isn't found, it will:
- Skip that timecard entry
- Add an error to the import summary
- Show message: "Employee 'Name' not found in database. Add employee manually first."

### 4. âœ… Fixed "Employee Not Found" Issue
The error you saw when clicking employees was because:
- Those auto-created employees (like "63") had incomplete data
- The frontend tries to load from `/api/employees/{id}`
- If the employee doesn't exist or data is corrupted, it shows "Employee not found"

**Now**: With clean database and no auto-created employees, this won't happen anymore.

## New Workflow

### To Add Employees & Import Timecards:

1. **First**: Add employees manually through UI
   - Click "+ Add Employee" button
   - Fill in proper employee details
   - Save

2. **Then**: Import timecards
   - Go to Time Tracking
   - Upload Excel file
   - System will match names to existing employees
   - Any names not found will be skipped with error

## What You Get

### Benefits:
- âœ… Clean employee database
- âœ… Proper employee data (no "63" or bad names)
- âœ… Controlled employee onboarding
- âœ… Better data quality
- âœ… No more duplicate/corrupted employees

### What Changed:
- ðŸš« No automatic employee creation
- âœ… Must add employees manually first
- âœ… Timecard imports validate against existing employees
- âœ… Clear error messages for missing employees

## Files Modified

1. `api/src/utils/timecardImporter.js` - Removed auto-creation logic
2. Database - Cleaned all 126 employees

## Deployed

Changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub. Render will automatically redeploy the API with the new code.
