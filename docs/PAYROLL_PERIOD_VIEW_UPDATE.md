# Payroll Period View Update

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… Complete

## Overview

Updated the Payroll page to display all employees who worked during a selected pay period, similar to the Time Tracking Day View implementation. This provides a cleaner, more intuitive interface for reviewing payroll data.

## Changes Made

### 1. **New Period View Component**
- Completely rewrote `/web/src/pages/Payroll.jsx`
- Displays all employees who worked in a selected 2-week pay period
- Grid/card layout showing payroll summary for each employee
- Only shows employees with approved timecard data (filters out 0-hour employees)

### 2. **Pay Period Selector**
- Dropdown selector similar to Time Tracking's date selector
- Shows all available pay periods from approved timecards
- Displays employee count for each period
- Automatically selects the most recent period on load

### 3. **Employee Cards**
Each card displays:
- **Employee Info**: Name, email, department
- **Hours Breakdown**: Total hours, regular hours, overtime hours
- **Pay Information**: Hourly rate, regular pay, overtime pay, gross pay, net pay
- **Vacation Accrual**: Hours and dollar value accrued (4% of total)

### 4. **Detailed Modal Popup**
Clicking an employee card opens a detailed modal showing:
- Complete hours breakdown with calculations
- Itemized pay breakdown (regular + overtime)
- Gross pay, deductions, and net pay
- Vacation accrual details
- Pay period dates and pay date
- Calculation methodology notes

## API Endpoints Used

### Primary Endpoints
- `GET /api/payroll-simple/periods` - Get all available pay periods from approved timecards
- `GET /api/payroll-simple/calculate-live` - Calculate payroll on-the-fly for a specific period

### Data Flow
1. Load available pay periods on component mount
2. Select most recent period by default
3. Fetch live payroll calculations for selected period
4. Filter to only show employees with timecard data (hours > 0)
5. Display in grid format
6. Show detailed breakdown in modal on click

## Features

### âœ… Implemented
- Period-based view (2-week pay periods)
- Employee filtering (only those with timecard data)
- Real-time payroll calculations from approved timecards
- Detailed employee payroll breakdown modal
- Responsive grid layout
- Professional UI with proper formatting

### ðŸ’¡ Key Improvements
- **No More Empty Data**: Only shows employees with actual timecard entries
- **Live Calculations**: No need for separate calculation step - computed on-the-fly
- **Better UX**: Similar pattern to Time Tracking for consistency
- **Detailed Insights**: Modal provides complete payroll breakdown
- **Proper Filtering**: Based on approved timecards only

## Payroll Calculation Logic

### Hours Calculation
```
Total Hours = Sum of all approved timecard entries for the period
Regular Hours = Total Hours - Overtime Hours
Overtime Hours = Sum of (daily hours > 8) for each day
```

### Pay Calculation
```
Regular Pay = Regular Hours Ã— Hourly Rate
Overtime Pay = Overtime Hours Ã— Hourly Rate Ã— 1.5
Gross Pay = Regular Pay + Overtime Pay
Net Pay = Gross Pay - Deductions (currently $0)
```

### Vacation Accrual (4%)
```
Vacation Hours = Total Hours Ã— 0.04
Vacation Pay = Gross Pay Ã— 0.04
```

## Technical Details

### Component Structure
```
Payroll (Main Component)
â”œâ”€â”€ Period Selector (dropdown)
â”œâ”€â”€ Summary Stats (pay date, employee count)
â”œâ”€â”€ PeriodView (grid of employee cards)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Employee Cards (clickable)
â””â”€â”€ EmployeeDetailModal (popup)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Hours Breakdown
    â”œâ”€â”€ Pay Breakdown
    â”œâ”€â”€ Vacation Accrual
    â””â”€â”€ Calculation Notes
```

### State Management
```javascript
- payPeriods: Array of available periods
- selectedPeriod: Currently selected period object
- payrollData: Array of employee payroll records
- selectedEmployee: Employee for detail modal
- showDetailModal: Boolean for modal visibility
- loading: Loading state
```

## Why It Works Better

### Before
- Showed periods with $0.00 for all employees
- No clear data visibility
- Confusing multiple tabs
- Import-focused workflow

### After
- Only shows employees with actual data
- Clear payroll summary at a glance
- Simple period selector
- Click for details workflow
- Consistent with Time Tracking UX

## Testing

### Manual Test Steps
1. âœ… Navigate to Payroll page
2. âœ… Verify pay periods load in dropdown
3. âœ… Select a period with employee data
4. âœ… Confirm only employees with timecards are shown
5. âœ… Click an employee card
6. âœ… Verify detailed modal opens with correct data
7. âœ… Close modal and verify it returns to grid
8. âœ… Switch periods and verify data updates

### Expected Behavior
- Loads most recent period by default
- Shows 0 employees if no approved timecards exist
- Filters out employees with 0 hours
- Displays correct calculations
- Modal shows detailed breakdown
- All currency formatted properly
- All hours formatted to 2 decimals

## Notes

### Timecards Are Automatically Counted
**As of October 10, 2025**: The system now counts **ALL timecards** automatically - no approval needed. If timecard entries exist for an employee in a pay period, they will show up in payroll calculations immediately.

**Previous Behavior**: Required timecard approval  
**Current Behavior**: Timecards exist = automatically included in payroll

### Pay Period Logic
- Based on Friday payday schedule
- 2-week periods (Saturday to Friday)
- Week 1 Saturday â†’ Week 2 Friday = Pay Period
- Payday is Friday of Week 3
- Example: Sep 8-19 pay period â†’ Sep 26 payday
