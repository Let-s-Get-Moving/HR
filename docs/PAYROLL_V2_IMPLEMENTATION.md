## Payroll Calculation Logic

### Regular Pay
```
regular_pay = regular_hours × hourly_rate
```

### Overtime Pay
```
overtime_pay = overtime_hours × (hourly_rate × 1.5)
```

### Gross Pay
```
gross_pay = regular_pay + overtime_pay
```

### Vacation Accrual (4%)
```
vacation_hours_accrued = (regular_hours + overtime_hours) × 0.04
vacation_pay_accrued = gross_pay × 0.04
```

### Net Pay
```
net_pay = gross_pay - deductions
(Currently no deductions, so net_pay = gross_pay)
```

---

## Pay Schedule

### Configuration
- **Base Date:** September 26, 2025 (last payout)
- **Frequency:** Bi-weekly (every 14 days)
- **Next Pay Date:** October 10, 2025
- **Period Length:** 14 days (pay period ends day before pay date)

### Upcoming Schedule
1. Sept 27 - Oct 10, 2025 (Pay: Oct 10)
2. Oct 11 - Oct 24, 2025 (Pay: Oct 24)
3. Oct 25 - Nov 7, 2025 (Pay: Nov 7)
4. Nov 8 - Nov 21, 2025 (Pay: Nov 21)
5. ...continues every 2 weeks

---

## Vacation Pay System

### Accrual
- **Rate:** 4% of all hours worked
- **Timing:** Accrued with every payroll
- **Tracking:** Automatic via database triggers
- **Balance:** Shown in hours and dollar amounts

### Balance Components
- **Earned:** Total vacation ever earned
- **Paid:** Total vacation ever paid out
- **Balance:** Current available vacation (earned - paid)

### Payout Process
1. Employee or admin requests payout
2. System validates sufficient balance
3. Calculates payout at current hourly rate
4. Creates payout record
5. Automatically deducts from balance
6. Records approval and timestamp

## Workflow Example

### Complete Payroll Cycle

#### Week 1-2: Timecard Collection
```
Sept 27 - Oct 10, 2025
- Employees work and clock in/out
- Timecards uploaded to system
- Admins review and approve timecards
```

#### Day of Pay Period End: Generate Payroll
```
Oct 10, 2025
1. Admin goes to Payroll → Generate Payroll
2. Clicks "Generate Payroll Now"
3. System processes:
   ✓ Fetches all approved timecards for Sept 27 - Oct 10
   ✓ Calculates pay for 15 employees
   ✓ Creates 15 payroll records in Draft status
   ✓ Shows summary: $37,500 total gross pay
```

#### Review & Approve
```
Oct 10, 2025 (same day or next business day)
1. Admin goes to Payment History tab
2. Reviews each payroll record
3. Clicks "Approve" on each one
4. System updates vacation balances automatically
```

#### Process Payments
```
Oct 10, 2025 (after approval)
1. Admin processes payments via banking system
2. Returns to Payment History tab
3. Clicks "Mark Paid" on each payroll
4. Status changes to Paid
```

#### Vacation Payout (As Needed)
```
Any time after vacation accrual
1. Employee requests vacation payout
2. Admin goes to Vacation Balances tab
3. Finds employee (e.g., John Doe has 80.5 hours)
4. Clicks "Pay Out"
5. Enters hours (e.g., 40 hours)
6. System calculates: 40 × $25.00 = $1,000
7. Clicks "Process Payout"
8. Balance updated: 80.5 - 40 = 40.5 hours
```
