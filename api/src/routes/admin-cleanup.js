/**
 * Admin Cleanup Routes - COMPLETELY DISABLED
 * 
 * These routes have been PERMANENTLY DISABLED due to causing accidental data loss.
 * All endpoints now return 403 Forbidden.
 * 
 * Root Cause:
 * - Someone clicked "Delete All Employees" button in Settings
 * - This triggered CASCADE DELETE that wiped out:
 *   â€¢ ALL timecards
 *   â€¢ ALL hourly_payout records
 *   â€¢ ALL commissions
 *   â€¢ ALL time_entries
 * 
 * Fix:
 * - All cleanup endpoints now blocked at middleware level
 * - Frontend buttons completely removed
 * - Data cleanup only via controlled terminal scripts
 * 
 * Date Disabled: 2025-10-03
